## Create & Use Trait in Laravel

In this repo is an example of how to use a Student trait.

Traits in laravel allow you to develop reusable pieces of code and inject it into controlers and models in your laravel application.

Once you have the repo setup, head to /stuents and you will see the trait being injected to the controller and out comes the list of students.
